# Awesome AI in Libraries [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Libraries hold an increasing amount of digital data that can be extracted, analysed and processed using different AI methods for different use cases. Some libraries manage this internally, others set up projects and others yet have a dedicated labs environment.

Please feel free to populate this list with your project or initiative ([how-to](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md)) or drop an email to cenl.ng.ai@gmail.com to inform us about it.

## AI Initiatives in Europe

### Research projects
- [NewsEye](https://www.newseye.eu/), funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, is a research project advancing the state of the art and introducing new concepts, methods and tools for digital humanities by providing enhanced access to historical newspapers. NewsEye makes use of AI approaches for document analysis, OCR, text analysis.
- [Impresso](https://impresso-project.ch/) (EPFL-DHLAB, UUZH-CL, C2DH). The objective of the project "Media monitoring of the past. Mining 200 years of historical newspapers" is to enable critical text mining of newspaper archives with the implementation of computational linguistics tools to extract, process, link, and explore data from print media archives.
- [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) (Turing Institute, British Library) is a research project that rethinks the impact of technology on the lives of ordinary people during the Industrial Revolution

### Internal projects
- National Library Finland:
  - [Automatic description of digital data](https://www.cenl.org/national-library-finland-high-performance-digitisation-giving-a-boost-to-the-description-of-digital-data/) using an intelligent annotation pipeline for semi-automated annotation (adding metadata) and enrichment of archived material, such as newspapers, books and official documents.
  - [Annif](https://annif.org/): tool for automated subject indexing and classification
- **Bibliothèque nationale de France**: 
  - [GallicaPix](https://gallicapix.bnf.fr/), hybrid retrieval of heritage images

- Helsinki Central Library Oodi:  [Headai](https://medium.com/headai-customer-stories/customer-story-oodi-1d1ef2554bb6), a virtual information assistant 
- Royal Library of Belgium : [Cataloguing Books](https://www.realdolmen.com/en/case-study/artificial-intelligence-helps-royal-library-of-belgium), a tool developed in Windows Powerapps, that detects metadata based on title page (title, author, publisher, and so on). Future developments: detection of type of page (is the page to be treated a title page, or a colophon, or back cover), and based on the results, other actions (title pages: metadata title, author, publisher), colophon (detect metadata isbn, legal deposit number, names, publisher), and back cover (subject indexing)
