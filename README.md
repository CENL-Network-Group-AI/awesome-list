# Awesome AI in Libraries [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Libraries hold an increasing amount of digital data that can be extracted, analysed and processed using different AI methods for different use cases. Some libraries manage this internally, others set up projects and others yet have a dedicated labs environment.

Please feel free to populate this list with your project and initiative ([how-to](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md)) or drop an email to cenl.ng.ai@gmail.com to inform us about it.

## AI Initiatives in Europe

### Research projects
- [NewsEye](https://www.newseye.eu/), funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, is a research project advancing the state of the art and introducing new concepts, methods and tools for digital humanities by providing enhanced access to historical newspapers. NewsEye makes use of AI approaches for document analysis, OCR, text analysis.
- [Impresso](https://impresso-project.ch/) (EPFL-DHLAB, UUZH-CL, C2DH). The objective of the project "Media monitoring of the past. Mining 200 years of historical newspapers" is to enable critical text mining of newspaper archives with the implementation of computational linguistics tools to extract, process, link, and explore data from print media archives.
- [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) (Turing Institute, British Library) is a research project that rethinks the impact of technology on the lives of ordinary people during the Industrial Revolution
